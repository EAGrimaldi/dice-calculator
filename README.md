When designing table top role playing games, it is important to understand the full complexity of the dice rolls that your design employs. However, it can be difficult to intuit the behavior of a somewhat complicated dice roll at a glance.

This tool takes arbitrary dice roll expressions and outputs information such as the probability mass function.

# Work In Progress

Its kinda half finished right now. Use at your own risk.

## core functionality
* intelligent expression updates
* expression simplifier
* expression compiler

## extended dice mechanics
* keep highest/lowest x in pool
* reroll highest/lowest x in pool
* successes over/under x in pool
